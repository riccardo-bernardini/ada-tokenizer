# What is this?

This directory stores some test code.  Currently you find here

1. A `bash` script `test.sh` that runs some test cases
2. `src/test_tokenizer.adb` a simple Ada program to test the library.  It can be run both interactively (run the command with no argument for some help) or in *terse mode* (with option `-q`) suitable for using it in scripts such as `test.sh`
